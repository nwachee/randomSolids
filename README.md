# My Fun Journey into Smart Contract Development

Hey there!  
I'm diving headfirst into the world of Web3 and learning how to build magic on the blockchain with Solidity. This repo is a growing collection of projects, experiments, and notes from my journey.

---

## Why I'm Doing This

Because coding smart contracts is like writing spells for the internet — and I want to be a wizard 🧙‍♂️

---

## What You'll Find Here

- 🧪 **Simple smart contracts** from Remix and Foundry
- 💸 **dApps** like funding contracts and storage logic
- 🧠 **Experiments** with oracles, deployments, gas optimizations
- 🛠️ **Tests** written with Foundry
- 📝 Notes, learnings, and lightbulb moments

---

## Tools

- [x] Solidity
- [x] Foundry 
- [x] Ethers.js
- [x] React + Wagmi

---

## Progress Timeline

✅ Wrote my first contract in **Remix**  
✅ Deployed to testnet using **Foundry**  
✅ Connected to **Chainlink oracles**  
🔜 Build a mini DAO & a cool NFT project  
🔜 Join a hackathon and contribute to a DAO

## Follow Along

I'll be building in public and documenting as I go.  
Feel free to **star ⭐**, **fork 🍴**, or just **vibe 💫**.

Let’s make the blockchain fun!
